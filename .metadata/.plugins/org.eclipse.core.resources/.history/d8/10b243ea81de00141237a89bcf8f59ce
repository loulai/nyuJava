Welcome to my assignment!

1. Run ExpressionTree.java
2. Type in the expression that you want to be converted. You can omit spaces if you like (oh the freedom).
3. Watch as the magical preorder, inorder and postorder forms of the expression appears!
4. Enter 'Y' to watch the magic all over again. 

Some things to note:

 - I have created my own class called LLTreeNode. It is similar to an LLNode, but instead of 
   just having one child, it now has two children (left and right).
   
 - there is a superfluous amount of parenthesis in the inorder traversal printing, and I'm aware of that (sorry!).
   But the equation still makes sense, so I was hoping that you would at least award me most of the marks, although
   I understand it won't be the full score. :)
