Runtime Analysis for Part 2
=================

Runtime is dependent on long the linked list is. 
For example, if there were 4 nodes and the list was recursive, the method's while loop will run 3 times.
If there were 3 nodes, it runs 2 times.

Thus, in the situation of recursive lists, the running time for the algorithm is n - 1, or just n.

The runtime for a non-recursive list is shorter.
