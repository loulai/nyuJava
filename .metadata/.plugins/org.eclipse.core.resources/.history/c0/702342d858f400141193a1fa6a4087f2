Welcome to the last assignment! [UPDATED VERSION, now reads from command line and includes text file]

1. In the terminal, cd into src.
2. From the terminal, compilation is called with command '$javac AssignmentMain.java'.
3. From the terminal, run '$java AssignmentMain data'. (the name of the text file is 'data')
4. Watch the code magically find out the shortest distance!

Notes:
 - All methods are called from the Main method in AssignmentMain.java.
 - I had some fun and added a method that displays the tree visually. You can remove that if you
   like, it will not affect the code.
