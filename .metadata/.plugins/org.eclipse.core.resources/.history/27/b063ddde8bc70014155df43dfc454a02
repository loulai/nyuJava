Runtime Analysis for Part 2
=================

Runtime is dependent on long the linked list is. 
For example, if there were 4 nodes and the list was recursive, the method's while loop will run 4 times.
If there were 3 nodes, it runs 3 times.

Thus, in the situation of recursive lists, the running time for the algorithm is just n.

The runtime for a non-recursive list is shorter.
If there were 6 nodes, the while loop will run only 2 times because the while loop only runs if the next two nodes do not point to null.
If there were 5 nodes, the while loop runs also only twice for the same reason.
If there were 4 nodes, the while loop runs only once, similarly because after one iteration the condition of the next two nodes not
pointing to null no longer holds true.
If there were 3 nodes, the while loops runs one too. 
The while loop never runs if there are two or less nodes, because the second node already points to null so the condition for the
while loop is false.

Thus, to be really picky, in the situation of non-recursive lists, the runtime is (n-1)/2.
