Welcome to the last assignment!

1. In the terminal, cd into src.
2. From the terminal, compilation is called with command '$javac AssignmentMain.java'
3. From the terminal, run '$java AssignmentMain data'. (the name of the text file is 'data')
1. Run AssignmentMain.java. All methods are called from that Main method.
2. Watch the code magically find out the shortest distance!

Note: I had some fun and added a method that displays the tree visually. You can remove that if you
      like, it will not affect the code.
